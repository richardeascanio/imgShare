# imgShare

social network app with Nodejs and MongoDB 
hosted at: https://imgshare-app.herokuapp.com

Used Nodejs tools like:

Express: to create the server (backend),
express-handlebars: to build semantic templates effectively with no frustation,
mongoose: to connect my app to mongoDB database,
morgan: to help me see the client requests in console,
multer: to upload the images to server, 
fs-extra: Filesystem, to manage the files when they are in the server (i used -extra to handle promises and async-await),
errorhandler: to paint the client an error when they access a route that doesn't exist,
md5: Gravatar, to generate random profile images to the users that make comments in the app.
